At first, Anna and I mostly focused on what kind of project we should create based on our personal interests. Anna enjoys cooking, while I am interested in tracking progress at gym and maintaining a healthy diet. After some discussions and exploration of various idea ranges in other fields such as chemistry and physics we came with idea that would combine both of our interests: a nutrition-based recipe generator. This idea allowed us to blend Anna's love for culinary arts with my focus on fitness and nutrition, making it a practical and engaging project for both of us.
We wanted to make a project that would not only fulfil our interests, but also provide something useful and valuable to users who care about both fitness and diet. From my experience I’ve noticed that many people struggle with maintaining healthy diet particularly when it comes to balancing nutritional requirements with taste for better progress at the gym. On the other hand, Anna expressed that while cooking can be enjoyable, it often becomes a challenge to come up with recipes that align with specific criteria, especially when considering dietary restrictions and the available ingredients. By merging these two aspects, we realized we could create a tool that would allow people to meet their fitness goals through personalized meal planning, without having to sacrifice the joy of cooking or eating delicious food.
After settling on the concept, we started discussing the main functionalities of the recipe generator. Our primary intention is to design a user-friendly platform where users can input specific dietary goals, such as calorie intake, macronutrient ratios, ingredient preferences and restrictions and ingredient availability. One of the key elements of our project is to incorporate filter algorithms into the recipe generator to help users find meals that fit their specific needs. Users will be able to filter recipes based on ingredients they already have at home, or dietary restrictions they follow. Additionally, users can input specific nutrition goals—like calorie limits and macronutrient targets (protein, carbs, fat) —so that the system can recommend recipes that align with their personal fitness objectives. The system would also feature an algorithm to find the top 10 rated meals from list of websites that we will choose.
Another important feature will be the account creation process, where users provide their basic information, including weight, height, age, gender, and their weight or fitness goals. This data will help us create more tailored nutritional plans. A personalized account would allow the user to track their progress over time and adjust their nutritional goals as needed. The platform would offer users the ability to add all their criteria—from dietary restrictions and nutritional goals to ingredients they have at home—before finding best recipes.
We also plan to include a notifications feature. Users will receive notifications with recommended meals based on their past selections, progress, and goals. This will make the platform more dynamic and engaging, ensuring that users receive updates and meal suggestions that keep them on track with their diet plans.
